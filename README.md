# Webscraping_mkbhd_youtubedata_EDA

Data set is uploaded in kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/upparipavan/mkbhd-youtube-videos-2008-2022

Ignore duration column as it grabbed the duration of ad played at the start of video :(

Web Scraping - Firstly, I performed web scraping to grab data. Here is code link - https://github.com/pavanuppari42/Youtube_webscraping

Cleaning the data - I fixed the dtypes of column and removed dirty data.

EDA - Finally, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis
